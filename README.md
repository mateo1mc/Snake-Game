Below is an overview of the functionality and structure of the game:


## Game Overview
- The game consists of a snake (controlled by the player) that moves around the screen eating food.
- The snake grows longer as it eats food, and the player earns points.
- The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game boundaries.
- The player can control the snake's direction using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys on the keyboard.
- Pressing the spacebar toggles the game between paused and running states.


## Components

### Snake
- The snake is represented by a circle-shaped head and additional segments as it grows.
- The snake's movement is controlled by the player's input.
- The snake's head changes direction based on the player's keystrokes.

### Food
- The food is represented by a circle-shaped object with random colors.
- When the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player earns points.
- The food's position is randomly generated on the screen.

### Score
- The game keeps track of the player's score and the highest score achieved.
- The score increases each time the snake eats food.
- The highest score is displayed along with the current score.


## Game Controls
- The player can control the snake's direction using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys.
- Pressing the spacebar toggles the game between paused and running states.


## How to Play

- Run the Python script.
- Use the keys 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' to control the snake's direction.
- Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.
- Press the spacebar to pause or resume the game.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included in Python standard library)


## Additional Notes

- The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Turtle module.
- The code includes comments to explain the functionality of each section and component.
- Feel free to modify and extend the code to add new features or customize the gameplay experience.
